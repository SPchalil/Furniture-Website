# Furniture Website

 A "design conversion"- a static webpage development, built from scratch as practice to get good understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

 A major project undertaken on my path towards learning web based software development. 

### How to run
 
 The website is hosted on Github Pages, https://spchalil.github.io/Furniture-Website/
 You can also clone the repository and use LiveServer in VSCode to run index.html and check out an offline version on your local machine.
